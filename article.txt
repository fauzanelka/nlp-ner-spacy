Manager Philippe Clement is demanding his Rangers team "create habits, connections and consistency" after they responded to Sunday's damaging defeat at Kilmarnock with a vibrant four-goal Europa League victory over FCSB. The Belgian said before the game that it was "not about the reaction, it's about the performance" - but he got both after a week of intense criticism in the Ibrox side's biggest European win since 2007. Vaclav Cerny teed up Tom Lawrence's opener and netted a classy double in a standout performance, before Hamza Igamane sealed the dominant win with his first goal for the club. "We were all sick of losing," Clement said. "Everybody was disappointed about Sunday and we wanted to stand up altogether. "I still see a lot of things we can improve on, but I'm happy everybody can see there's potential in this squad. We need time to connect everything together. "I'm looking forward to the future with this squad. It's about creating habits, connections and consistency. We're going to work hard on that." Despite increasing discontent among the fanbase following the weekend's abject loss, a vocal home support still provided their full backing in Govan. They were stunned within minutes of the first whistle, however, when David Miculescu dispossessed a dithering Jack Butland and rolled in what he thought was an opener, but the goalkeeper's blushes were spared as a foul was given by the referee. It was a moment that could have spooked Clement's men, but they got the goal their high-octane start deserved when questionable goalkeeping allowed Lawrence to squeeze in a curled effort from the edge of the box. And it was 2-0 just after the half-hour mark when Cerny won possession in the final third before bending a fine strike into the far corner with his weaker right foot.
